# What is my purpose?

You shutdown the computer!

## The real purpose is

- Ever missed your bus/tram/train because you sat 5 minutes too long at your pc coding?
- Ever stood in traffic because you sat 5 minutes too long at your pc coding?

### &#8594; install this on your computer!

- Ever wanted to see the face of your collegue, when he did not commit for hours and his/her computer just shuts down
- Ever wanted to make your collagues crazy shutting their computers down every day at a certain time (recommend: during lunch)

### &#8594; install this on your friends/collegues computer (i recommend as a startup-script, as ppl usually start their pc and then go get a coffee, while waiting at the booting process)! All lots of fun and tewars are guaranteed. All in all this is a fun usecase, but know your enemies, so dont do this to people, who are not fun at parties
